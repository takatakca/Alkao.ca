# ALKAO — TAKATAK Ticket Hub

ALKAO is the standalone, detachable ticketing engine of GROUPE TAKATAK. Each TAKATAK Client
(for example Havana Resort or FESTI-ICE) uses it as a separate tenant: its own catalog,
inventory, buyers, orders, tickets, permissions and finances.

GROUPE TAKATAK V1 (`takatak-v1`) stays the master control plane: identity, Clients, Brands,
memberships, entitlements, platform billing and the dashboard shell. ALKAO never reads the
TAKATAK database. It keeps local projections, which TAKATAK updates through a signed,
versioned control contract.

## Stack

- Node 22 and TypeScript (strict)
- PostgreSQL with Supabase-compatible RLS; SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations`
- `pg`, Zod, Hono (API, PR 3)
- Vitest, tested against local ephemeral PostgreSQL only

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/domain` | Pure rules: money, Québec taxes, cart rules, quotes, commission and refund policy, state machines, entitlement gate, role permissions |
| `src/db` | Pool, transactions, migration runner, inventory and order primitives |
| `supabase/migrations` | Schema. Every `ticketing_*` table enables RLS in the migration that creates it |
| `supabase/tests/supabase_shim.sql` | Local test stand-in for Supabase roles, `auth.uid()` and default grants |
| `test/` | Domain, RLS, invariant and migration-rule tests |
| `docs/` | Capability status and architecture decisions |

## Run the checks

```bash
npm ci
npm run db:local:start   # ephemeral PostgreSQL on 127.0.0.1:54329
npm run qa               # typecheck + static migration RLS rules + all tests
npm run db:local:stop
```

## Security rules (frozen)

- No `ticketing_*` table exists without RLS in the same migration.
- `anon` has no grants and no policies. `authenticated` gets SELECT only, through membership
  policies. Buyer data and order money are visible to owner, admin and manager only.
- No write policies: all writes go through the ALKAO server.
- Ticketing is disabled by default. Every operational route checks, server-side, the
  deployment switch, the Client and Brand status, and the TAKATAK Ticketing entitlement for
  that exact Client and Brand.
- Every business-scoped record carries both `client_id` and `brand_id`. Composite foreign
  keys stop a record from referencing another tenant's parent.

## Roadmap

| Run | Scope |
|---|---|
| Run 01 | PR 1 capability status · PR 2 domain, schema, RLS, invariants · PR 3 API contracts and entitlement gates |
| Run 02 | Stripe Connect direct charges, application fee, refunds |
| Run 03 | Signed QR credentials (stable ids and key version only), scanner manifest, scans |
| Run 04 | Operations UI in the TAKATAK dashboard |
